# dellsBot - RMTB Bot-in-browser PoC
## About
This bot started off as a PoC for running RMTB bots in the browser.
## How do I build this?
0. Make sure you have the pre-requisites (Node.js, NPM) installed.
1. Open a terminal in the project's directory
2. In order to install the required packages, run `npm i`
3. Once they're installed, run `npm run build`. If you're updating the bot and the update only affects the configuration and/or commands, use `npm run update-bot` instead.
4. Open the HTML file under `dist`
## Licensing
